                                        across the group.<br>

                                        “Our aim was that every marketer at Vodafone reaches what we would describe as a
                                        minimum
                                        acceptable standard of digital marketing skills, knowledge, and capability, and

                                        But not only does Vodafone have a very large workforce, it is also spread all

                                        Natasha Brookes is a Learning and Development Specialist at Vodafone. For her,
                                        it was clear that
                                        a digital marketing course needed an online solution.<br>

                                        “Vodafone is a large global organization. In order to reach all of the marketers
                                        within the
                                        different markets, what better way to do it than having one place where
                                        marketers can come and
                                        learn? And it will be a consistent learning approach.”<br>

                                        The Digital Marketing Institute realized early on that Vodafone is a company
                                        that wants to set
                                        the pace, not just keep up with it. They didn’t just want a foundation to their
                                        digital
                                        marketing, they also wanted to train their staff to be up-to-date and current in
                                        their knowledge
                                        and skills, so they could anticipate what their customers would want.<br>

                                        “I had the greatest degree of confidence in the Digital Marketing Institute,
                                        both in terms of
                                        quality of content and their global certification standard, which we could apply
                                        across all of
                                        our markets,” stated Ghafoor <br>

                                        Fortunately, the Vodafone Marketing Academy had a learning management system, or
                                        e-learning
                                        system, already set up. Having a learning management system meant that their
                                        staff already knew
                                        the benefits of learning online. The next step was to find the right partner, to
                                        provide the
                                        content the company needed. <br>

                                        To get Vodafone started, The Digital Marketing Institute began by carefully
                                        picking topics and
                                        courses that were most relevant to Vodafone and their staff. They then agreed a
                                        global user
                                        license that gave Vodafone’s staff access to 15 of the DMI modules. Their staff
                                        could choose
                                        from modules in both the Professional Diploma in Digital Marketing and from the
                                        Specialist
                                        Diplomas. <br>

                                        Institute team then
                                        worked with Vodafone to integrate core modules and content into their e-learning
                                        system to make
                                        it easy for their global workforce to train together, wherever they were, and
                                        whenever it
                                        suited. The video-based learning content is now used by Vodafone Marketing

                                        over the world. <br>

                                        A launch was also successfully supported by with a range of creative promotions
                                        – from e-flyers
                                        to newsletters and helped generate awareness and enthusiasm for the courses
                                        through internal
                                        campaigns. Today, The Digital Marketing Institute continues to work with
                                        Vodafone to certify
                                        their workforce, and help the company realize their full digital potential. <br>

                                        “I found the relationship to be a really positive one. One that was
                                        constructive. It certainly
                                        felt to me that what I was saying about Vodafone’s needs and requirements in
                                        this space was
                                        being listened to,” concluded Mohsin. <br>

                        end, the Marketing Academy in Vodafone was seeking a relevant, in-depth and effective
                        professional education course to sharpen the digital skills of their workforce.

                        Development at Vodafone, Mohsin Ghafoor’s task was to raise standards in digital marketing,
                        across the group.<br>

                        “Our aim was that every marketer at Vodafone reaches what we would describe as a minimum
                        acceptable standard of digital marketing skills, knowledge, and capability, and be able to apply
                        that to their day job and have an impact on our customers.”<br>

                        But not only does Vodafone have a very large workforce, it is also spread all over the world.
                        Natasha Brookes is a Learning and Development Specialist at Vodafone. For her, it was clear that
                        a digital marketing course needed an online solution.<br>

                        “Vodafone is a large global organization. In order to reach all of the marketers within the
                        different markets, what better way to do it than having one place where marketers can come and
                        learn? And it will be a consistent learning approach.”<br>

                        The Digital Marketing Institute realized early on that Vodafone is a company that wants to set
                        the pace, not just keep up with it. They didn’t just want a foundation to their digital
                        marketing, they also wanted to train their staff to be up-to-date and current in their knowledge
                        and skills, so they could anticipate what their customers would want.<br>

                        “I had the greatest degree of confidence in the Digital Marketing Institute, both in terms of
                        quality of content and their global certification standard, which we could apply across all of
                        our markets,” stated Ghafoor <br>

                        Fortunately, the Vodafone Marketing Academy had a learning management system, or e-learning
                        system, already set up. Having a learning management system meant that their staff already knew
                        the benefits of learning online. The next step was to find the right partner, to provide the
                        content the company needed. <br>

                        To get Vodafone started, The Digital Marketing Institute began by carefully picking topics and
                        courses that were most relevant to Vodafone and their staff. They then agreed a global user
                        license that gave Vodafone’s staff access to 15 of the DMI modules. Their staff could choose
                        from modules in both the Professional Diploma in Digital Marketing and from the Specialist
                        Diplomas. <br>


                    </div>
                    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="v-pills-result" role="tabpanel"
                        aria-labelledby="v-pills-settings-tab" tabindex="0">The Digital Marketing Institute team then
                        worked with Vodafone to integrate core modules and content into their e-learning system to make
                        it easy for their global workforce to train together, wherever they were, and whenever it
                        suited. The video-based learning content is now used by Vodafone Marketing Academy staff all
                        over the world. <br>

                        A launch was also successfully supported by with a range of creative promotions – from e-flyers
                        to newsletters and helped generate awareness and enthusiasm for the courses through internal
                        campaigns. Today, The Digital Marketing Institute continues to work with Vodafone to certify
                        their workforce, and help the company realize their full digital potential. <br>

                        “I found the relationship to be a really positive one. One that was constructive. It certainly
                        felt to me that what I was saying about Vodafone’s needs and requirements in this space was
                        being listened to,” concluded Mohsin. <br>
